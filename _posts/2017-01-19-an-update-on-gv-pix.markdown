Did I say I was moving my photoblog to SmugMug?

Well, I was wrong. 

I decided to host it in Squarespace instead. I am still using SmugMug as a private photo delivery for friends and family with a different domain, but my photography site and photoblog has been moved to Squarespace. 

Don't get me wrong, but SmugMug is great, but setting up a somewhat photoblog style website is a little hard. 

Setting it up and customizing it took a little while, but everything seems to be in order now. 

Photos look great. The site loads fast. the templates are beautiful and customizing it was quite easy. 

So, check out [GV Pix](https://gvpix.com).
