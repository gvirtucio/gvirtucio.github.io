So.

When I thought my photoblog was all set and done using Tumblr, I now decided to move it to SmugMug. 

Tumblr was easy to use and good. Even better was that it's free. I chose a great theme that I love. But I needed a way to share some family photos too, privately. SmugMug offered that option, and that is why I chose to move it there. 

It's a good thing I haven't posted that many photos yet. All I have to do now is finish customizing my site, uploading my photos, then it's good to go. 

Good luck to me!
