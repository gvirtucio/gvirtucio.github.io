Hi! I am **Greg Virtucio**. Some people know me as **GV**. I use **gvirtucio** as my social handle. 

I am a [hobbyist / amateur photographer](http://gvpix.com), a web host and a systems analyst based in Antipolo, Philippines.

I started with my photography hobby in 2008, with the Sony Ericsson K800. I really loved that phone, and it had an awesome camera.

My very first "real" camera was the *Sony Nex-5R* with the 16-50mm kit lens. I then bought a Canon FD 50mm 1.4 SSC, and I simply fell in love with it. This started my craving for manual lenses. 

Manual lenses I have:

- Canon FD 50mm f1.4 SSC
- Canon FD 85mm f1.2L
- Canon FD 70 - 200mm f4
- Canon FD 135mm f2.8
- Minolta MD W.Rokkor-X 24mm f2.8

Today, my everyday camera is the *Sony A6000*. Perfect size and weight for me. I have it with me almost everyday with my SEL 50mm f1.8. My cameras and lenses are:

Sony Nex-6 and Sony A6000:

- Sony E 16 - 50mm f3.5 - 5.6
- Sony Vario-Tessar E 16-70mm f4 ZA
- Sony E PZ 18 - 105mm F4 G
- Sony Sonnar T* E 24mm F1.8 ZA
- Sony E 18 - 55mm f3.5 - 5.6
- Sony E 50mm f1.8
- Sony E 55 - 210mm f4.5 - 6.3

Fujifilm X-T1:

- Fujifilm XF 18 - 135mm f3.5 - 5.6 R
- Fujifilm XF 23mm f1.4 R
- Fujifilm XF 56mm f1.2 R

Sony native lenses are what I use mostly nowadays, but I still use my manual ones whenever I feel like it.

I mostly shoot street, candid, landscape, cityscape or whatever I feel like capturing. 

I post my photos at Instagram, [gvirtucio](https://www.instagram.com/gvirtucio/), and my photoblog, [GV Pix](http://gvpix.com). Higher resolution photos are available thru [my Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregvirtucio/) with an Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons license.
