Hi! I am Greg Virtucio. People call me GV. 

I am a [hobbyist / amateur photographer](http://gvpix.com), a web host and a systems analyst.

I started with my photography hobby in 2012. I mostly shoot street, candid, landscape, cityscape or whatever I feel like capturing. 

My very first camera was the Sony Nex-5R with the 16-50mm kit lens. I then bought a Canon FD 50mm 1.4 SSC, and I simply fell in love with it. This started craving for manual lenses. 

Manual lenses I had:

- Canon FD 50mm f1.4 SSC
- Canon FD 85mm f1.2L
- Canon FD 70 - 200mm f4
- Canon FD 135mm f2.8
- Minolta MD W.Rokkor-X 24mm f2.8

Today, my everyday camera is the Sony A6000. Perfect size and weight for me. I have it with me almost everyday with my SEL 50mm f1.8. My cameras and lenses are:

Sony Nex-6 and Sony A6000:

- Sony E 16 - 50mm f3.5 - 5.6
- Sony Vario-Tessar E 16-70mm f4 ZA
- Sony E 18 - 55mm f3.5 - 5.6
- Sony E 50mm f1.8
- Sony E 55 - 210mm f4.5 - 6.3

Fujifilm X-T1:

- Fujifilm XF 18 - 135mm f3.5 - 5.6 R
- Fujifilm XF 23mm f1.4 R
- Fujifilm XF 56mm f1.2 R

Sony native lenses are what I use mostly nowadays, but I still use my manual ones whenever I feel like it.

I post my photos at Instagram, [gvirtucio](https://www.instagram.com/gvirtucio/), and my photoblog, [GV Pix](http://gvpix.com). Higher resolution photos are available thru [my Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregvirtucio/) with a Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons license.
